    <p>People who roam the web and creates and designs different parts of it tend to have a good eye towards both Free/Libre Open Source Software and Creative Commons. This is also true for hackers, teachers, librarians and many others.</p>
    <p>But as soon as you say "design", someone tries to force you to use any product from Adobe. It might be tools that many use, but it is not the tools you have to use.</p>
    <p>So where can we find the open and free tools to do our craft? Where are the people who use these tools to teach and spread the knowledge of the web?</p>
